Notebooks
=========

We use jupyter notebooks for debugging, finding hyperparameters, and investigating results.
Specifically, we created the following notebooks:

:debug_environments.ipynb:
    Manually walk through the environments, experiment with configurations, and debug.

:debug_wrapper.ipynb:
    Step-wise observe the observations of the different wrappers for debugging.

:preprocess.ipynb:
    Find the hyperparameter configuration with the best reward averaged over multiple seeds and combine multiple results files.

:training.ipynb:
    Visualize the training progress and outcomes.

:evaluation.ipynb:
    Visualize the results of the evaluation rollouts.
